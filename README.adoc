An example of how I use React + Redux + Material-UI + TypeScript.

Or: The code I wish existed when I got started.

This is how I do it â€“ *you do you* ðŸ’–

== Setup & Tooling
** https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app[create-react-app] for project setup:
*** Compilation, linting, etc.
*** Development mode with auto-reloading
*** Test watcher
*** Optimized production build
*** see <<scripts, Available Scripts>>
** https://prettier.io[Prettier] for formatting, auto-triggered on commit via https://github.com/typicode/husky[Husky]
** http://extension.remotedev.io/[Redux DevTools] for state management debugging

== Structure
Organize *by feature*:

* Each feature gets its own folder:
** Defines its own model/actions/reducer
** Defines its own components, clearly separated into presentation (inside `components` folder) and glue-code/logic (inside `containers` folder)
** Exports selectively through its `index.ts` file

When using the feature:

* Only ever import what is officially exported:
** âœ… `import { Foo } from './feature-x'`
** ðŸš« `import { SecretInternalComponent } from './feature-x/components/SecretInternalComponent'`)
* Avoid circular dependencies â€“ sooner or later, a `shared` folder will be needed ;-)

== State Management

* Keep state in a *fully typed, immutable* model:
** Use interfaces or type aliases rather than classes
** Use TypeScript's `readonly` keyword
** Use https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js[immutable] collections
* Use https://redux.js.org/[Redux] to store and manage state:
** Define a `RootState` by composing the various feature-specific models
** Define a `RootReducer` by composing the feature-specific reducers, each being responsible for the feature-specific state slice.
** Write container components to connect presentation components to the Redux store. *Why?* Presentation components are more re-usable if they don't know how state is shaped nor how it's managed.
** Use https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk[redux-thunk] for async actions

== Broad Overview

== User Interface

Use https://material-ui.com/[Material-UI], a React component library based on https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_Design[Material Design]:

* Huge selection of components, fully customizable
* Theme support (e.g. light vs dark)
* CSS in JS (or in TS, actually): Reusable, component-scoped styles

My CSS skills are embarrassing, but https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout[CSS Grid Layout] gives me super powers.
I use it for everything.

== Testing

I am mostly developing prototypes these days, so I am not an expert when it comes to testing.
However, this is the minimum I *always* test:

* Root reducer: Making sure each action is handled correctly (~80% of my logic)
* Error-free rendering of each component

== Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/netzwerg/react-you-do-you.git
cd react-you-do-you
yarn install
yarn start
```

_Feel free to use `npm` rather than `yarn` â€“ I have a slight preference for `yarn`, mainly because of https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions/[resolutions] support_

[[scripts]]
== Available Scripts

=== `yarn start`

Compiles and runs the app in development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any compile or lint errors in the console.

=== `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

=== `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

=== `yarn run lint`

Runs ESLint (with TypeScript support) on all `&#42;.ts` or `&#42;.tsx` files in the `src` directory.

=== `yarn run lint:fix`

Runs ESLint (with TypeScript support) on all `&#42;.ts` or `&#42;.tsx` files in the `src` directory, automatically *fixing* problems.
